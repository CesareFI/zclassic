 * Purpose: the mesh-status lane's private cross-TU contract. The combined
 * file passed the 800-line shape ceiling, so the requester lane (begin:
 * pairing preflight, session lookup, pending admission, request send) lives
 * in boot_mesh_status_requester.c while boot_mesh_status.c keeps the shared
 * state, the pure helpers, the responder lane, receipt ingress, poll, and
 * lifecycle. Production code outside those two translation units must not
 * include this header; the focused wire test includes it to exercise the
 * exact bounded-table contract.
