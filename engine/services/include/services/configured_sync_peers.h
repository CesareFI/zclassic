/* Copyright 2026 Rhett Creighton - Apache License 2.0
 * Purpose: the peers this node's operator explicitly named as connection
 * targets, the Noise identity this node itself authenticated at each of
 * those addresses, and the one rule that lets an inbound session proven to
 * carry that identity serve headers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two routable nodes told to addnode each other end up with
 * one TCP connection: the sealed connection manager keeps the session dialed
 * by the lower Noise static key and evicts the other
 * (core/modules/net/src/connman_zcl23_dial.c, called from msg_version.c at
 * the inbound VERSION and the outbound VERACK). The node left holding only
 * the other's inbound connection never began header sync, because an inbound
 * peer may not become a header source (anti-eclipse), and FINDING_PEERS has
 * no edge to AT_TIP. It stayed out of sync forever.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROVEN, NOT CLAIMED. Neither the TCP source IP nor anything the
 * peer says (VERSION addr_from, gossip) authorizes anything here: several
 * machines can share one NAT address. The binding is cryptographic:
 *   1. The operator names a target address (-addnode=, -connect=,
 *      -addnode-file=, or the authenticated `addnode add|onetry` RPC).
 *   2. THIS node dials that exact address and completes a Noise XX handshake
 *      as initiator. XX message 2 carries the responder's static key under
 *      the ee and es keys, so completing it proves the host answering at the
 *      configured address holds that static private key. That is the
 *      target's authenticated identity. It is learned either from an
 *      ordinary outbound session to the target that reaches PEER_ACTIVE, or
 *      from a dedicated identity probe (configured_sync_peers.c) that
 *      completes the same handshake and closes before VERSION, so the sealed
 *      eviction never sees it.
 *   3. An inbound session qualifies only when its OWN Noise session is
 *      established and the static key it authenticated (XX message 3) equals
 *      the identity learned in step 2 for a target at the same IP. Nothing
 *      is cached per inbound session or per IP: every new session is checked
 *      against its own handshake, so a reconnect proves the binding again.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SECURITY-EQUIVALENT TO THE OUTBOUND DIAL. An outbound sync
 * source is whoever holds the static key that answered at the configured
 * address. An admitted inbound session is authenticated as that same key.
 * A same-NAT neighbour, a spoofed addr_from or a replayed session cannot
 * produce it. Plaintext inbound sessions, Tor/loopback sources (every Tor
 * hidden-service stream arrives from 127.0.0.1) and addresses learned from
 * DHT hints, gossip, seeds, anchors or onion directory walks never qualify.
 * The rule only chooses which peer may be ASKED for headers; header and
 * block validation, download windows, per-peer limits and misbehaviour
 * scoring are the ones every peer gets, and the peer must also be
 * PEER_ACTIVE, the same handshake state an outbound peer needs. */
