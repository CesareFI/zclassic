# Node engineering coordination

This note records validated public-node findings that another development
branch should check before duplicating work. It does not set priorities or
describe live production state.

## Block-swarm peer manifest reach

Block-swarm assignment previously used the swarm-wide manifest range when a
peer supplied no piece bitmap. A peer advertising a shorter, independently
anchored manifest could therefore be assigned pieces beyond that peer's own
advertised end. Those out-of-range requests were invalid for that peer, could
increase the requester's misbehavior score and lead to a ban, and degraded IBD
reliability.

Assignment now caps each peer's reach at that peer's anchored manifest end.
Peers advertising the full range retain full reach, and peers without a
manifest retain the prior scheduling behavior. Block validity, header
admission, peer-side request validation, and consensus rules are unchanged.

The focused regression completes the first five of eight pieces, proves a
five-piece peer receives no later assignment, and proves full-range and
unknown-range peers still receive later work. The block-swarm loopback group
also passed, transferring 2,560 blocks (3,962,880 bytes) at approximately
22,888 blocks/s and 33.8 MiB/s while retaining disconnect reassignment and
stall recovery behavior.

Validation at commit `0caeed6d1`:

- `test_utxo_commitment`: passed, including the peer-manifest cap regression.
- `test_block_swarm_loopback`: passed.
- core seal, consensus-parity, complexity, generated capability inventory,
  and diff-whitespace gates: passed.
- The cold canonical suite ran 1,160 of 1,169 groups in 1,183.7 seconds:
  1,139 passed, 21 unrelated infrastructure/environment groups failed, nine
  parameter-heavy groups were gated, and 22 groups self-skipped. The host ran
  out of disk during the 500,000-file code-index scale case; later storage,
  database, resident, and development-tool failures occurred in that exhausted
  environment. Neither changed group failed.

Follow-up: block-swarm stall and restart timing still needs an audit for
wall-clock rollback behavior. Any change must preserve the legacy-download
ownership window after abandonment and must not change validation semantics.

## Block-swarm restart cooldown clock

The 300-second post-abandonment cooldown was process-local but stored the last
abandonment as Unix wall time. A backward civil-clock correction made elapsed
time negative and could leave legacy download holding ownership far beyond the
intended interval; a forward jump could expire it early.

The abandonment stamp and restart comparison now use monotonic seconds. Zero
explicitly means no prior abandonment, a reversed monotonic sample fails
closed without subtraction, and every later abandonment starts a fresh full
cooldown. The state remains non-persistent, so process restart continues to
clear the cooldown as before. Regression coverage pins immediate retry,
299/300-second boundaries, backward and large forward wall-clock changes,
defensive monotonic reversal, reset, and repeated abandonment cycles. The
block-swarm loopback remained green, moving 2,560 blocks at approximately
32,017 blocks/s and 47.3 MiB/s in the measured focused run.

Remaining timing risk: the separate silent-stall age and progress-report
cadence still use wall time and should be audited independently; neither is
part of restart-cooldown authority after this change.
